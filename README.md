# TitanicSurvivalPrediction

# Introduction
Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! This repository contains code and data to predict passenger survival on the infamous RMS Titanic using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, fare, and whether they survived or not.

# Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not based on the provided features. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover patterns and insights from the data that can aid in understanding the factors influencing survival rates.

# Data Source
The dataset used for this project is the famous "Titanic" dataset available on Kaggle or access through following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file. It consists of two CSV files: train.csv (used for model training).

# Model Evaluation
The performance of the predictive model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics on a test dataset. The model's predictions will be compared against the actual survival outcomes to measure its effectiveness.
